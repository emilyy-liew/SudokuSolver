# SudokuSolver
This program can solve any sudoku with equivalent difficulty to a NY Times Easy Puzzle.
You type in the placement of the numbers at the beginning of the program to match the sudoku puzzle you are trying to solve, and it will return the solved puzzle.

# Note for Typing in the Numbers
The program you to input each row of a given sudoku puzzle using 0's as placeholders for the blank boxes.<br />
If there is a row of zeroes, you can just put in one 0 as a shortcut!<br />
Another tip is to leave out leading blank spaces in the puzzle. For example, if you were to type 001040030 for the row, it would be the same as typing in 1040030. So, if there are any blanks before a non-zero number, feel free to start with the non-zero number and finish the row.
